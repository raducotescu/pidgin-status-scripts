These scripts will change your status in Pidgin on Linux by providing them the
feed to your blog or the feed to your Twitter statuses.

To be able to change your Pidgin's status, both of them need to have access to
some environment variables which are set by the accompanying export_x_info.sh
which should be set to run after each boot.

Provided that you use GNOME as your Desktop Environment, to add the previous
script to the list of applications that are run after each boot, go to
System - Preferences - Startup Applications.

The two Python scripts used for changing Pidgin's status must then be called from
a cron job. E.g.:

# m h  dom mon dow   command
SHELL=/bin/bash
DISPLAY=:0.0
*/5 * * * * source ~/.Xdbus; ~/bin/python_script.py feed_url
